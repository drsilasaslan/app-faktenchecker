## API Usage

This extension requires a Perplexity API key to function. Here's what you need to know:

- You'll need to obtain an API key from Perplexity
- The extension uses the `sonar-reasoning-pro` model, which provides high-quality fact-checking results
- Monitor your API usage through your Perplexity account to understand your personal usage patterns

Tips to maximize your API usage:
- Focus on shorter, specific statements for the most efficient use
- For longer texts, select the most crucial parts for fact-checking
- Keep track of your API usage to stay within your desired limits

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the extension, try these solutions:

1. **API Key Issues**: 
   - Ensure your Perplexity API key is entered correctly
   - Use the "Test Key" button to verify your API key is valid
   - Check that your Perplexity account is active

2. **No Response or Errors**:
   - Check if you've exceeded your API credits
   - Try using the "Retry" button if the fact check fails
   - Refresh the page and attempt the fact check again
   - Look for error messages in the fact check popup

3. **Missing Information**:
   - If some sections (like truth percentage or context) are missing, try using the "Retry" button
   - Very long selections may be truncated - try selecting a shorter piece of text
   - Some highly specialized or very recent topics may have limited sources

If problems persist, please open an issue on GitHub with details about the error.
